# RotemX junior+ / mid-level front end interview exercise

This is a simple front end interview exercise, that tests the knowledge of the candidate in runtime performance debugging and react best practices.

Notice the app is written poorly, with a ton of code duplication and purposeful mistakes.
Try to fix as much as you can in the remaining time of the interview.

Bugs: 

1. Try writing in any of the inputs above the lists in the app, and see what happens. Try to think how you can solve this runtime performance problem.
2. Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable. Keep your code DRY.

Features:

1. Add the ability to move a user from the "Employees" list to the "Management" list. Discuss with the interviewer the possible ways that these two components could communicate.
2. Add all the basic CRUD functionalities to BOTH lists. (Create, Read, Update, Delete employee/manager)
